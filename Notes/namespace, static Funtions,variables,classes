Static Variable inside Functions 
    
    The static variables hold the value of the variable through the function calls. Retains the value throught the program.

Static Class Objects 
        
    The object will have a lifetime of that of the programs lifetime.Destructor is called at the end of programs end.

Static Member Variables in class 
    
    Simillar to that of the static variable inside a function, the static variable insdie a Class will be retained through the objects (The variable is shared by the objects ).
    These static variables cant be initialised by a constructor and they are to be intialised outside the class explicitly.
